# Under construction - WIP

# Initial idea

I was watching my son doing some online learning homework and got the idea to build a kids website where they could improve there Maths and Spelling skills

I want my son to be able to choose between either Maths or spelling, then have a count down timer and either random Maths questions or random images are generated/displayed which he can answer. I'm thinking of including a record table or a 'Top 10 scores style table' to keep track of progress
